<!-- Here, introduce the general principles of open science and the motivation for worcs -->

# Defining Open Science

* “Open science is just good science” (Jonathan Tennant, 2018)
* TOP guidelines (Nosek et al., 2015)
* FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016)
---

# TOP guidelines

1. **Citation** of literature, data, materials, and methods;
1. **Sharing** data;
1. **Sharing** the code required to reproduce analyses;
1. **Sharing** new research materials;
1. **Sharing** details of the design and analysis;
1. **Pre-registration** of studies before data collection;
1. **Pre-registration** of the analysis plan;
1. _Replication of published results._

.footnote[[Nosek _et al._, 2015](https://osf.io/9f6gx/#!)]
---

## ...in a FAIR manner

* **F**indable data etc.
* **A**ccessible online for humans and machines
* **I**nteroperable: Everything in an easy-to-adapt format
* **R**eusability; people can use your data, your code, your materials in cloned projects

.footnote[Wilkinson et al., 2016]

# Why open science?

Sterling, 1959:

![](images/sterling_1959.png)
---

# Why open science?

* Scientiﬁc fraud (Levelt, Noort, & Drenth, 2012)
* Questionable research practices (John, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2012)
* P-hacking / p-ritual (Gigerenzer, 2018)
* Replication crisis (Shrout & Rodgers, 2018)

So: Open science as punishment for bad science?

# Open science as a paradigm shift

#### Open Science creates opportunities to make science more
- reliable, 
- cumulative
- collaborative, 
- inclusive

# Open science as a challenge

#### Where do you start?

#### What tools do you need to learn?

#### What workflow is right for you?

# Introducing WORCS

### **W**orkflow for **O**pen **R**eproducible **C**ode in **S**cience
- A standardized workflow
- Conceptual platform-independent principles: https://psyarxiv.com/k4wde
- "One-click" solution in R: https://cran.r-project.org/package=worcs
- Based on best practices (several experts contributed)
- Compatible with existing requirements and other workflows
- Pulling down the learning curve!

<!-- Here, give a conceptual platform-independent outline of WORCS.
This requires some thought; for now, just foreshadow the worcs infograph
to give attendees some idea of what practical issues we address.
No detail at this stage -->

# The tools

## 1. Dynamic document generation
## 2. Version control
## 3. Dependency management

# 1. Dynamic document generation

- Paper consists of **text and code**
- Results, figures, and tables automatically generated
- Formatted as APA paper (including citations!)

### Important because:

- Save time from copy-pasting output and formatting paper
- Eliminate human error in copying results;
- When revising the paper, **all** results are automatically updated;
- Reproducible by default: Just generate the document

---

# 2. Version control (using Git)

Tracks differences in (text-based) files line by line:
![diff](images/play-changes.svg)

Save tracked changes to the _repository_, and _commit_ with a descriptive message:

# Introducing GitHub
.pull-left-larger[
- `worcs` repository is pushed to [GitHub](https://github.com/);

- GitHub is a "cloud backup"...

- ... as well as a "social network" platform;

- GitHub can be used to 'tag' specific states of the repository, e.g. a preregistration.
]

![prereg](images/preregistration.png)

---
# Important because:

- Complete backup of entire project history
    * Go back to previous version if you want
    * Prove that you preregistered your plans and followed them
- Easy collaboration online (even with strangers)
    * People can copy your project and build on it
- GitHub can be your preregistration, your research archive, supplementary materials, comments section, etc.
- Connects to OSF.io project page
    * Improves **F**indability
    * Obtain DOI for project and/or specific resources
- Connects to Zenodo
    * Obtain DOI for project and/or specific resources
    * Store project snapshot

---
# 3. Dependency management

- To make project reproducible, people must have access to your (exact) **software dependencies**
    * For R-users, these are `R-packages`

- Difficult trade-off:

# Dependency management in WORCS

- Maintains text-based list of packages, their version,  
  and origin (e.g., “CRAN”, “Bioconductor”, “GitHub”)
- This list can be version-controlled with Git;
- When a user loads the project,  
    `renv` installs all dependencies from the list
    
### Important because:

- Essential for reproducibility
- Good for collaboration (everybody has same versions)
- Your code is self-contained and will work in the future

<!-- With the background knowledge in mind, let's have another look at the workflow -->
---
# Unique features in `worcs`

* RStudio template
* Easy GitHub integration
    - Add URL during project creation
    - `git_update("Commit message")`
* Manuscript and preregistration templates
    - From `rticles`, `papaja`, and `prereg`
    - Original templates for secondary- and longitudinal data
* Solutions for data sharing
* Cite `@essential` and `@@nonessential`
* Worcs checklist and badge

---

# Sharing data in WORCS

- Reproducibility requires open data
- Adolescents' data may be (privacy) sensitive

#### Use `open_data()`:

- Original data made public as `.csv` file

#### Use `closed_data()`:

- Original data saved locally;
- Synthetic data created using `synthetic()`
- Synthetic data made public as `.csv` file
- Unique ID for original data made public (so people can audit your work)

#### Loading data `load_data()`:
- Reads original `data.csv` if present
- Otherwise, reads `synthetic_data.csv`
- Your scripts can ALWAYS be reproduced
- People can submit a working script to you, to run on the original data
